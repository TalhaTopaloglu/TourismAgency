The room types of the hotels will be limited to 4 types as single room, double room, junior suite, suite room. Instead of adding the same type of rooms to the system over and over again, stock logic is used. Also, the properties of the rooms must be entered.

Agency personnel can add rooms to hotels and search for rooms for reservation through this screen. When you go to the room addition page, the hotel, one of the 4 room types, one of the pension types registered in the hotel's system and one of the periods registered in the hotel's system are selected. According to the selections made, the nightly price information for adults, nightly price information for children and the number of stocks are entered. In addition, the number of beds, square meter information from the following room features, and whether the room is in the room or not from other room features should be saved in the system. All information about the room must be displayed on the room listing screen.


## Reservation Management
#### After listing the rooms with the desired features, the agency user starts the reservation process for the room requested by the customer. When the reservation process is started, the total price should be calculated automatically and the reservation is completed by taking the contact information of one of the customers.
